# Irck! The IRC Keeper

Irck is a persistent irc client-daemon service.  It can handle man users, each on many networks.  It currently provides a web-based client, and one of the highest priority goals is to provide an IRC server-based client, so you can connect to Irck with whichever IRC client you are most comfortable--and you can optionally make only one client connection for your many service connections!  But that's not here yet!

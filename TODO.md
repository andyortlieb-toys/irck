## Things to do:

    * Hook up to a database

	* Join/Manage channels
		* front end (web ui)
		* back end
	
    * Initiate PRVMSG to a friend

    * Topic

	* User security

    * Freenode joins don't get applied to correct channel

    * NOTICE

    * User lists for channels -- front end/back end

    * Get the IRC consoles to make sense. Jeez... "*"/"AUTH"/"" ... outta control!

    * Nickserv recognition/automation

    * Look at all other IRC events supported by the irc-event library that we haven't used yet.  They're probably important, right?
